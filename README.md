# H72 Arduino libraries
This is where the Arduino libraries that I make will go.

## COMPLETED
None yet, although I'm close to finishing one.

## WORK IN PROGRESS
- Joybus library - Interface with Joybus devices (N64, GCN, GBA) with your Raspberry Pi Pico/RP2040

## PLANNED
- H72 Utils - A utility library that condenses several patterns that I see into a library for easier use (e.g. printing to an I2C LCD display)
